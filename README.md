A_beginner_journey
05.02.2025- This project shows the stages and processes I went through on my way to becoming a software developer. In this project, I share my experiences and what I learned on the path to becoming a software developer, which I started many times in the past but ended due to reasons (excuses actually) such as lack of motivation and economic conditions. My aim is to share the learning process and the codes, projects I have written, including the simplest ones. Even though I'm just at the beginning as of today's date (05.02.2025), I hope to be able to show the paths I've gone through to new beginners with this project.

Update 1- 11.02.2025 I ended HTML courses and started CSS.
