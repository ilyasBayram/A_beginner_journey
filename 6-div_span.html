        The &lt;div&gt; tag is a block-level element used to group other HTML
        elements together. It is commonly used for styling and layout purposes.
        By using &lt;div&gt;, you can apply CSS styles to a group of elements or
        manipulate them with JavaScript. It does not inherently carry any
        semantic meaning. Divs are often used in combination with classes and
        IDs for more specific styling and scripting.

    <div id="second_block">
      <h2>A wibsite second block</h2>
      <p>
        The <span style="background-color: yellow">&lt;span&gt; </span>tag is an
        inline element used to group other HTML elements together. It is
        commonly used for styling purposes, such as changing the color or font
        size of a specific section of text. By using &lt;span&gt;, you can apply
        CSS styles to a specific portion of text within a larger block of
        content. Like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt; does not carry any semantic
        meaning on its own and is often used in combination with classes and IDs
        for more specific styling.

    <div id="third_block">
      <h3>A wibsite third block</h3>
      <p>
        The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags are both essential tools for web
        developers when it comes to styling and scripting HTML content. While
        &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element used for grouping larger sections
        of content, &lt;span&gt; is an inline element used for styling specific
        portions of text or other inline elements. By using these tags in
        combination with CSS and JavaScript, you can create visually appealing
        and interactive web pages.
